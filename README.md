## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to segment customers on Mall Customer Segmentation Data
Market Basket Analysis based on their purchasing behavior using unsupervised learning techniques. The project will utilize a dataset containing customer transaction information to identify patterns and characteristics that distinguish different customer groups.

## Project Objectives

- Identify key features that influence customer purchasing behavior
- Develop a customer segmentation model using clustering algorithms
- Analyze and interpret the results to gain insights into customer behavior
- Provide recommendations for marketing strategies and targeted promotions

## Dataset Description

- The dataset contains customer transaction information, including:
    - **InvoiceNo**
    - **StockCode**
    - **Description**
    - **Quantity**
    - **InvoiceDate**
    - **UnitPrice**
    - **CustomerID**
    - **Country**

## Methodology

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Clustering Algorithm Selection
4. Model Evaluation and Interpretation

## Expected Outcomes

- A customer segmentation model that identifies distinct customer groups
- Insights into customer purchasing behavior and preferences
- Recommendations for targeted marketing strategies and promotions


summary of the analysis:

The analysis aimed to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. The dataset consisted of transactional data, including StockCode, InvoiceNo, CustomerID, UnitPrice, and Quantity.

Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: The data was cleaned, and missing values were handled.
2. Clustering: K-Means clustering was applied to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior (UnitPrice and Quantity).
3. Cluster Analysis: The characteristics of each cluster were analyzed, including demographics, purchasing behavior, and profitability.
4. Targeted Marketing: Based on the cluster analysis, targeted marketing strategies were developed to retain high-value customers, increase revenue, and improve customer satisfaction.

Use of Mode:
The mode was used to identify the most frequent Quantity purchased by customers in each cluster. This helped in understanding the typical purchasing behavior of customers in each segment.

Key Insights:
- Cluster 0 was identified as a profitable segment with high average order value and frequency.
- Customers in Cluster 0 typically purchased quantities of 6 units.
- Targeted marketing strategies were developed to retain high-value customers in Cluster 0.

Recommendations:
- Implement targeted marketing campaigns to retain high-value customers in Cluster 0.
- Analyze customer feedback and purchasing behavior to identify opportunities for upselling and cross-selling.
- Consider offering loyalty programs or rewards to incentivize repeat business from customers in Cluster 0.
